	Simple Rest API

What is it?
-----------

The Simple Rest API is web application written to satisfy two needs:
.- Maintaining a repository of email/repository pairs
.- Check the most active Github users of a city
It is developed using Spring 4. This framework has been chosen by the developer
because he had been years using Spring and, after a halt, he was eager to use it
back, this time with no xml configurations.

How to use it?
-----------------
This version contains the source code, so it is a version for developers to test it
and check its fashion.
For code-checking purposes you can use any IDE, eclipse is recommended. You might 
open it and import it as as project.
For running you can use eclipse it self or maven
$ mvn spring-boot:run

Before starting using it you might want to create the database. You can create it with:
$mysql -u user -p password < src/main/scripts/candidacy.sql
and you might as well change the configuration of the connection in
src/main/resources/mysql.properties

Features
--------
1.- Add a user to its repository
You can add throughout a POST call, like this one on the command line:
$ curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -X POST -d '{"email": "some@email.com", "repository": "repository_name"}' http://localhost:8080/rest
Remember to set a valid e-mail and a repository with at least one alphanumerical character
If you send again the same request (same e-mail and repository) nothing will happen (not even a message error)
If you send an already sent e-mail, with a new repository, the repository for this e-mail will be modified

2.- Check the most active Github user of a city
This feature gives you the 10 most active users of a city with a list of his projects
You can call:
http://localhost:8080/github?city=barcelona
and receive a JSON formatted list of users/repositories
